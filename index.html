          Jewlery in the Americas has an ancient history. Beginning as far back as 8800 BCE, Paleo-Indians in the American Southwest drilled and shaped multicolored stones and shells into beads and pendants. Olivella shell beads, dating from 6000 BCE, were found in Nevada; bone, antler and possibly marine shell beads from 7000 BCE were found in Russell Cave in Alabama; copper jewelry was traded from Lake superior beginning in 3000 BCE; and stone beads were carved in Poverty Point in Louisiana in 1500 BC. <a href="#">Learn more.</a>
