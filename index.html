			<h2>About</h2>

			<p>"Mary Wanesia is Jeweler, an Arizonia native, and a member of the Navaho tribe.  She specializes in creating beautiful contemporary takes on the traditional adornments worn by Navaho in ceremonies and in daily life."</p>

			<p>"Jewelry in the Americas has an ancient history.  Beginning as far back as 8800 BCE, Paleo-Indians in the American Southwest drilled and shaped multicolored stones and shells into beads and pendants.  Olivella shell beads, dating form 6000 BCE, were found in Nevada: bone, antler, and possibly marine shell beads from 7000 BCE were found in Russell Cave in Alabama; copper jewelry was traded from Lake Superior beginning in 3000 BCE; and stone beads were carved in Poverty Point in Louisiana in 1500 BCE."
