			<h2> About </h2>
			<p> Mary Wanesia is Jeweler, an Arizona native, and a member of the Navajo tribe. She specializes in creating beautiful contemporary takes on the tradional adornments worn by Navajo in ceramonies and in daily life. </p>

			<p>Jewelry in the Americas has an ancient history. Beginning as far back as 8800 BCE, Paleo-Indians in the American Southwest drilled and shaped multicolored stones and shells into beads and pendants. Olivella shell beads, dating from 6000 BCE, were found in Nevada; bone, antler, and possibly marine shell beads from 7000 BCE were found in Russell Cave in Alabama; copper jewelry was traded from Lake Superior beginning in 3000 BCE; and stone beads were carved in Poverty Point in Louisiana in 1500 BCE.

			<p>Mary's jewelry has received recognition, and been featured in the National Museum of the American Indian, The New York Times Style Magazine, and Sedona Monthly. The collection been has sold across the United States and Europe and been carried by the retail stores of Bergdorf Goodman.</p>

<!-- The <section> element represents a generic section of a document or application. A section, in this context, is a thematic grouping of content. Each section should be identified, typically by including a heading (h1-h6 element) as a child of the <section> element.
Examples of sections would be chapters, the various tabbed pages in a tabbed dialog box, or the numbered sections of a thesis. A Web site’s home page could be split into sections for an introduction, news items, and contact information.
...
The <section> element is not a generic container element. When an element is needed only for styling purposes or as a convenience for scripting, authors are encouraged to use the <div> element instead. A general rule is that the <section> element is appropriate only if the element’s contents would be listed explicitly in the document’s outline.

The <figure> tag specifies self-contained content, like illustrations, diagrams, photos, code listings, etc.
While the content of the <figure> element is related to the main flow, its position is independent of the main flow, and if removed it should not affect the flow of the document.
