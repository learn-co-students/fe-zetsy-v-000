			<!-- paragraph -->
			   <P>Mary Wanesia is a jeweler, an Arizona native, and a member of the Navajo tribe. She specializes in
					creating beautiful, contemporary takes on the <br/>traditional adornments worn by the Navajo in ceremonies and in daily life.</P>

			<!-- paragraph -->
			   <p>Jewelry in the Americas has an ancient history. Beginning as far back as 8800 BCE, Paleo-Indians in the American Southwest
					  drilled and shaped <br/>multicolored stones and shells into beads and pendants. Olivella shell beads, dating from 6000 BCE, were found in Nevada;
						bone, antler, and <br/>possibly marine shell beads from 7000 BCE were found in Russell Cave in Alabama; copper jewelry was traded from
						Lake Superior beginning in <br/>3000 BCE; and stone beads were carved in Poverty Point in Louisiana in 1500 BCE.
